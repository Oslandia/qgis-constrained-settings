# Constraining user settings

This repo shows how to constrain user settings using a QGIS Startup Script. Constrained user
settings are settings that users cannot freely set or override. This targets environments where
administrators set properties in the global settings file that shouldn't be freely modified by
users in their user settings.

The startup script is [`pyqgis_startup.py`](pyqgis_startup.py). And the path to this script is to be
specified with the `PYQGIS_STARTUP` environment variable. For example:

```sh
$ PYQGIS_STARTUP=/home/user/pyqgis_startup.py qgis
```

QGIS will execute that script at startup time, and when switching profiles. The script is
responsible for rewriting the user settings based on the constraints defined in the "user settings
contraints" file.

The "user settings contraints" file is a YAML file that must be named
`qgis_constrained_settings.yml` and located in the same folder as that containing the global
settings file (`qgis_global_settings.ini`).

Note: the startup script won't be able to find the "user settings contraints" file if the file is
not named `qgis_contrained_settings.yml` or if it is not located in the same directory as the global
settings file.

Here is an example of a `qgis_constrained_settings.yml` file:

```yaml
---
propertiesToRemove:
  proxy:
  - authcfg
  - proxyEnabled
  - proxyExcludeUrls
  - proxyHost
  - proxyPassword
  - proxyPort
  - proxyType
  - proxyUser
propertiesToMerge:
  svg:
  - searchPathsForSVG
```

The section `propertiesToRemove` includes the properties that will be removed from the user settings
by the startup script. The first level, `proxy` in the above example, defines the group that
includes the properties.

The section `propertiesToMerge` includes the properties whose values will be merged with the values
defined in the global settings by the startup script. For example if `searchPathsForSVG` is set to
`/usr/qgis/svg` in the user settings and to `/global/qgis/svg` in the global settings then the
startup script will change the `searchPathsForSVG` to `/global/qgis/svg, /usr/qgis/svg` in the user
settings. The startup script will also remove duplicates.

Notes:

* The path to the startup script (specified with the `PYQGIS_STARTUP` environment variable) must be
  absolute for QGIS to be able to execute this script when switching profiles.
* The `PYQGIS_STARTUP` environment variable must be defined in a QGIS startup script (see
  [`qgis.sh`](qgis.sh) in this repo for an example), at a system level in a global manner, or in the
  global settings file (with `customEnvVars` in the `qgis` section).
* In this repo the `PYQGIS_STARTUP` environment variable is defined in the [`qgis.sh`](qgis.sh)
  script rather than in the global settings to avoid hard-coding the path to the script in the
  global settings.
* The `pyqgis_startup.py` script relies on the `qgis` PythonÂ module. This means that the `qgis`
  module must be available in `sys.path` when the startup script is executed. There's no problem
  on Linux, because PyQGIS is installed in the system-wide Python environment. On Windows, with
  QGIS installed with the OSGeo4W installer, the `qgis` Python module is installed in a specific
  folder (either `C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis\python`  or `C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\qgis-ltr\python`),
  which is not available in `sys.path` when the startup script is executed. For that reason
  it is necessary to modify the bat script used to launch QGIS, and add the PyQGIS installation
  folder to the `PYTHONPATH` variable. For example:
  ```
  set PYTHONPATH=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\qgis\python;%PYTHONPATH%
  ```
